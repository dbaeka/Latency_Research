<h1>Data Visualization Study </h1>

<h2>Section 2: Image Puzzle Task</h2>

<!--<p>You spent this much time in the previous task: <span id="trainingTime"></span></p>
<p>
This task involves a second image puzzle. The original task instructions are provided below, for
reference. This time, you will only have <b>50 seconds</b> to find one target picture. When you are
ready to start, please press "Continue" below.
</p>-->

<p>
You will only have <b>1 minutes and 40 seconds</b> to complete the task. The instructions are
provided below. When you are ready to start, please press "Continue" below.
</p>
<p>
In this portion of the study, you will view an interface which contains
several parts: a square window showing a portion of a collage of bird images; a
description of a picture to find within the collage (or a "target picture");
and two function buttons called "FOUND" and "FINISH".
</p>

<p>
There are two copies of the target picture within the collage.
The main task is to <b>find one copy of the target picture</b> within
the collage. You can <b>drag within the visualization window</b> to see more of
the image collage. There may be a delay before some images appear in the
collage.
</p>

<p>
When you find a copy of the target picture, move the target picture to the center
of the visualization window, and click on the "FOUND" button. The web page will
pop out a window to confirm whether you have made progress in the task or not.
The target picture will be clearly marked as found after the confirmation. You
can stop finding by clicking the "FINISH" button. Once you confirm to finish, you
will not be able to interact with the collage anymore.
