<h1>Data Visualization Study </h1>

Take a break... (If you need one)

<h2>Section 2: Personality Inventory</h2>

<p>In this portion of the study, you will be asked to fill out a short personality inventory. Please answer these questions as honestly as possible and based on how you feel right now. We are researching how people with different thinking styles and experiences explore visualizations, so this is a very important part of your participation.</p> 

<p>Caution: The survey includes control pattern checks and your time spent completing the task will be compared to other workers. <b>Simply clicking through this portion will result in being rejected.</b></p> 

<p>When you are ready to start, please press "Continue" below.</p>
