<h1>Data Visualization Study </h1>

<h2>Section 2: Image Puzzle Task</h2>

<p>
In this portion of the study, you will view an interface which contains
several parts: a square window showing a portion of a collage of bird images; a
description of a picture to find within the collage (or a "target picture");
and two function buttons called "FOUND" and "FINISH".
</p>

<p>
There is a single kind of target picture within the collage.
The main task is to <b>find the target picture</b>. You can <b>drag or zoom in/out within the
visualization window</b> to see more of the image collage. There may be a delay
before some images appear in the
collage.
</p>

<!-- <p>
<b>The target picture is either directly to the left or directly to the right of your starting position</b> in the collage. A diagram of the possible positions is provided below:
</p>
<img src="{{url_for('static',filename='img/perfect_diagram.jpg')}}" alt="target picture locations" height="350" width="500"> 
 -->
<p>
When you find the target picture, move the target picture to the center of the
visualization window, make sure that the zoom level has been set to the biggest (Level 5),
 and click on the "FOUND" button. The web page will pop
out a window to confirm whether you have completed the task or not. You can
stop finding by clicking the "FINISH" button. Once you confirm to finish, you
will not be able to interact with the collage anymore.
</p>

<p>
When you are ready to start, please press "Continue" below.
