<h1>Data Visualization Study </h1>

Take a break... (If you need one)

<h2>Section 3: Image Puzzle</h2>

<p>
In this portion of the study, you will view an interface which contains
several parts: a square window showing a portion of a collage of bird images; a
description of a picture to find within the collage (or a "target picture");
and two function buttons called "FOUND" and "QUIT".
</p>

<p>
The main task is to <b>find the two copies of the target picture</b> within
the collage. You can <b>drag within the visualization window</b> to see more of
the image collage. There may be a short delay before new images appear in the
collage.
</p>

<p>
When you find a copy of the target picture, move the target picture to the center
of the visualization window, and click on the "FOUND" button. The web page will
pop out a window to confirm whether you have made progress in the task or not.
The target picture will be clearly marked as found after the confirmation. You
can stop finding by clicking the "QUIT" button. Once you confirm to quit, you
will not be able to interact with the collage anymore.
