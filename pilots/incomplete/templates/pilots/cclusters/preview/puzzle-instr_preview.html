<h1>WARNING THIS IS ONLY A PREVIEW PAGE. THIS IS NOT THE REAL STUDY!</h1>
<h1>Data Visualization Study -- Preview</h1>

<h2>Section 2: Image Puzzle Task</h2>

<p>
In the next portion of the study, you will view an interface which contains
several parts: a square window showing a portion of a collage of bird images; a
description of a picture to find within the collage (or a "target picture");
and two function buttons called "FOUND" and "FINISH".
</p>

<p>
There are two copies of the target picture within the collage.
The main task is to <b>find one copy of the target picture</b> within
the collage. You can <b>drag within the visualization window</b> to see more of
the image collage. There may be a delay before some images appear in the
collage.
</p>

<p>
When you find a copy of the target picture, move the target picture to the center
of the visualization window, and click on the "FOUND" button. The web page will
pop out a window to confirm whether you have made progress in the task or not.
The target picture will be clearly marked as found after the confirmation. You
can stop finding by clicking the "FINISH" button. Once you confirm to finish, you
will not be able to interact with the collage anymore.
</p>

<!--
<p>
Below is a diagram that describes how the images are positioned within the collage (the diagram will also be displayed on the next page). 
This diagram is intended to help you to find the target images in an easier
and faster way, by helping you identify which zones you have explored and
which ones you have not.
The collage has six zones, and all of the images in each zone have the same
background color. As shown by the diagram below (from left to right), there are 2 zones of images
with a green background, 2 zones of images with a gray background, 1 zone of
images with a brown background and 1 other zone of images with a gray
background. <b>Your starting position will be in the center
of the color map.</b>
</p>
